# My Portfolio

This project is a personal software engineering portfolio website showcasing skills, projects, testimonials, and contact information.

## Features

- **About Me:** A brief introduction of professional background and approach to software engineering.
- **Skills:** Display of core competencies including JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, Docker, AWS, TypeScript, GraphQL, CI/CD, Agile, SQL/NoSQL, and RESTful APIs.
- **Projects:** Featured projects with descriptions, technology stacks, and links to source code repositories and live demos.
- **Testimonials:** Client and collaborator feedback highlighting professionalism and technical ability.
- **Contact Form:** A simple contact form to send messages with name, email, subject, and message fields.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly layout with smooth navigation and interactive UI elements.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the complete portfolio website with embedded CSS styling and Font Awesome icons.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Navigate through the sections using the navigation links at the top.
3. View skills, explore featured projects, read testimonials, or send a message via the contact form.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 with responsive design techniques
- Font Awesome for icons

## Notes

- The contact form currently triggers a simple alert on submission and resets the form; it does not send data to a backend.
- Project links and live demos use placeholder URLs and should be updated to actual destinations.
